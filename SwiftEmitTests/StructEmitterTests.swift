    // identified (or maybe 'categorized') by virtue of their number of sides.

    // on which handler was mapped to a struct with x sides. Confusing, but
    // with structs, you are effectively changing the identity of the value
    // when you change one of it's attribues. You can see the consequences of

      // swiftEmitId is derived only from the number of sides.
