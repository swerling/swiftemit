1. Get rid of Context, instead:

  1. Get rid of context, use IVs instead
  2. Add is a parent and children to Event:

      var parent: Event?
      var children = [Event]()

  * Create a thread local variable that holds the currently processed event. Clear it when event processed, and emit a log message about the event

  * If a new event comes in before current event is cleared, add cur event as
  parent of the new event, and new event as child to parent. Indent when
  emitting log message


2. Trying to figure out how to use generics on Event, so that you don't have
the redundant guard at the top of every handler.

Instead of this:

  func myFunc(event: Event) {
    guard let event = event as? Events.ValueChange else { return }
    if event.oldValue...
  }

Want something more like this:

  func myFunc(event: Events.ValueChange) {
    if event.oldValue...
  }

Having fooled around with this, one big problem is the mapping table technique. How to keep a map of handlers each with their own signiture?

I think if in the mapping table I put an "X as Handler" in the right spot, can pull this off. Not sure though.
